# Machine Learning Collection

This is a step by step process where you explore what you wanna learn, know where to lie and dive deeper. I believe, there is nothing such as perfection at learning 
a topic but teaching does the job. I will try to make the code as clear as possible. This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to add something 
then I'd happily merge a PR.

## Data Preprocessing
Coversion of raw data into a clean dataset and making it suitable for a machine learning model. 

**Myth** - Data is collected, organised and fed into model.

**Fact** - **FORBES**: Data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data. Data preprocessing is the method of analyzing, filtering, transforming and encoding data so that a machine learning algorithm can understand and work with the processed output.
